# akka-chat-websocket

## Installation

- [Install SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)
- [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install#install) (can use Homebrew on MacOS)

## Running

Start up SBT and launch using `run`. The compilation process is configured to download [lmt](https://github.com/driusan/lmt) automatically. But this will fail if Go is not installed.
